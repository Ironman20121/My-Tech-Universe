Because of this, I became eligible for a presidential fee waiver in the summer semester, which helped me with my tuition fees. In the summer, I took advanced computer security, where I learned about ethical hacking and all major operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS). I also completed an advanced network security course, doing 10 network labs that helped me understand the core principles of firewalls and other network concepts. Additionally, I studied advanced computer forensics, focusing on digital forensics for specific systems and major operating systems like Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android, using tools like FTK Imager and Autopsy. In the fall, I am learning about operating systems, machine learning, and soft security, which teaches me how to write secure software through defensive programmingâ€”skills that are essential today. After this journey, I am looking to take my next step toward a PhD in computer science."

          After 10th grade, I was passionate about becoming a physicist, but after my 12th grade, I started pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. It was an unexpected turn, but I found it really interesting, which led me to shift my focus from physics and math to programming, hackathons, and coding competitions. Now, I am doing my master's at UNG, which has been the best part of my journey to date.
